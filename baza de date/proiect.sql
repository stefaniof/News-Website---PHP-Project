This year&rsquo;s conference, the third annual, wrapped up on Wednesday.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a normal conference. No deals were made. No products were announced. In fact, there wasn&rsquo;t even any Amazon branding anywhere. During the two days in the desert, the 200 guests&mdash;including a Nobel Prize winner, astronauts, designers, and the actor and Parkinson&rsquo;s research advocate Michael J. Fox&mdash;explored their adventurous side with activities like knife making and biplane rides. Ostensibly, the focus of the conference was on the presentations the guests could make to each other about their work or passions. But the event&rsquo;s real power was a glimpse into Amazon&rsquo;s future.</p>\r\n<p>And it suggests that Bezos&rsquo;s plans for the company are expansive.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the talks discussed subjects on Amazon&rsquo;s existing product road maps, and many of the guests represented companies already aligned with its businesses. Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa voice-activated software is already integrated into products from speaker company Sonos and automaker Ford&mdash;and the CEO of Sonos and the CTO of Ford were both guests. Intel&rsquo;s CEO, Brian Krzanich, demonstrated indoor drones that could one day pick up an item off a sky-high shelf in an Amazon warehouse. And recent whispers about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/16/amazon-hiring-taha-kass-hout-former-fda-cto.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon&rsquo;s interest in health care&nbsp;</a>were backed up with presentations by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sondehealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonde</a>, an AI firm that can diagnosis mental and physical health from voice recordings, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.myseismic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seismic</a>, a clothing company that helps wearers gain more mobility thanks to robotic garments.</p>\r\n<p>But Bezos appears to have more far-out plans, too.</p>\r\n<p>Planetary scientists presented the latest discoveries on gravitational waves and pulsars. While research on gravitational waves is still ongoing, Bezos clearly thinks that a more nuanced understanding of gravity could shape innovations of the future. Pulsars could have implications for Bezos&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/20/17031836/jeff-bezos-clock-10000-year-cost\" target=\"_blank\">10,000-year clock</a>, a $42 million timepiece claimed to be an important way to think about humanity in the long term (<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/418326/where-is-the-best-clock-in-the-universe/\" target=\"_blank\">though some folks are skeptical about that</a>). Quite&nbsp;<em>how&nbsp;</em>this shapes Amazon&rsquo;s future is unclear, but it&rsquo;s obvious that Bezos is thinking very hard about it. (These particular topics do align nicely with his non-Amazon aerospace company, Blue Origin.)</p>\r\n<p>Most telling, though, was Bezos&rsquo;s sheer enthusiasm. He was on hand for the whole conference and paid close attention to everything, like an excited schoolboy turned billionaire entrepreneur. He sat in the front row. He tested demos (even playing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/techreview/status/976231159251324928\" target=\"_blank\">Ping-Pong against a robot</a>; he lost). He took control of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davegershgorn/status/976214322467635200?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Dynamics robo-dog</a>.

The winner may have the OS of the future.</h2>\r\n<p>For years, Swami&nbsp;Sivasubramanian&rsquo;s wife has wanted to get a look at the bears that come out of the woods on summer nights to plunder the trash cans at their suburban Seattle home. So over the Christmas break, Sivasubramanian, the head of Amazon&rsquo;s AI division, began rigging up a system to let her do just that.&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;</p>\r\n<p>So far he has designed a computer model that can train itself to identify bears&mdash;and ignore raccoons, dogs, and late-night joggers. He did it using an Amazon cloud service called SageMaker, a machine-learning product designed for app developers who know nothing about machine learning. Next, he&rsquo;ll install Amazon&rsquo;s new DeepLens wireless video camera on his garage. The $250 device, which will go on sale to the public in June, contains deep-learning software to put the model&rsquo;s intelligence into action and send an alert to his wife&rsquo;s cell phone whenever it thinks it sees an ursine visitor.</p>\r\n<p>Sivasubramanian&rsquo;s bear detector is not exactly a killer app for artificial intelligence, but its existence is a sign that the capabilities of machine learning are becoming far more accessible. For the past three years, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have been folding features such as face recognition in online photos and language translation for speech into their respective cloud services&mdash;AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Now they are&nbsp;in a headlong rush to build on these basic capabilities to create AI-based platforms can be used by almost any type of company, regardless of its size and technical sophistication.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Machine learning is where the relational database was in the early 1990s: everyone knew it would be useful for essentially every company, but very few companies had the ability to take advantage of it,&rdquo; says Sivasubramanian.</p>\r\n<p>Amazon, Google, and Microsoft&mdash;and to a lesser extent companies like Apple, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP&mdash;have the massive computing resources and armies of talent required to build this AI utility. And they also have the business imperative to get in on what may be the most lucrative technology mega-trend yet.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, the cloud is how most companies are going to make use of AI&mdash;and how technology suppliers are going to make money off of it,&rdquo; says Nick McQuire, an analyst with CCS Insight.</p>\r\n<p>Quantifying the potential financial rewards is difficult, but for the leading AI cloud providers they could be unprecedented. AI could double the size of the $<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3815165\" target=\"_blank\">260 billion</a>&nbsp;cloud market in coming years, says Rajen Sheth, senior director of product management in Google&rsquo;s Cloud AI unit. And because of the nature of machine learning&mdash;the more data the system gets, the better the decisions it will make&mdash;customers are more likely to get locked in to an initial vendor.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, whoever gets out to the early lead will be very difficult to unseat. &ldquo;The prize will be to become the operating system of the next era of tech,&rdquo; says Arun Sundararajan, who studies how digital technologies affect the economy at NYU&rsquo;s Stern School of Business. And Puneet Shivam, president of Avendus Capital US, an investment bank, says: &ldquo;The leaders in the AI cloud will become the most powerful companies in history.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just Amazon, Google, and Microsoft that are pursuing dominance.

Thankfully you can, as companies like System76 and Dell sell laptops and desktops with Ubuntu or Ubuntu-based operating systems.</p>\r\n<p>Another option? Buy a Mintbox! This is a diminutive desktop running Linux Mint &mdash; an Ubuntu-based OS. Today, the newest such variant &mdash; The Mintbox Mini 2 &mdash; makes an appearance.

They are:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Technology really can empower people to do great things</strong>. While that may just sound like a soundbite, the last few years I have felt it in new and meaningful ways, making me a real optimist about our future. Amongst so many other things, Windows has been a platform to consider basic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/10/26/empowering-a-new-wave-of-creativity-with-the-windows-10-creators-update-and-surface-studio/\">human creativity</a>, how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/05/02/microsoft-education-empowering-students-teachers-today-create-world-tomorrow/\">students will learn in the future</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/03/08/how-mixed-reality-is-changing-the-game-for-healthcare-from-performing-live-surgeries-to-delivering-ultrasounds-in-3d/\">how surgeons can will operate in the future</a>, and how people who are blind can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac9NsWUv3YM\">use their device without a display</a>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Broadly define who is on your team</strong>. The passion, commitment, and sheer brilliance of the people across Microsoft has kept me inspired for 21 years. I am so proud of the teams I have had the honor to lead. Windows has taught me to appreciate that some of my best teammates are at other companies like Intel, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung, Best Buy, Adobe, Autodesk, Activision, Electronic Arts, and so many others. We have worked together to move the industry forward, creating opportunity for so many along the way.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Have fun with it</strong>. My Microsoft journey has included some challenging days, but I barely remember them. Looking at a photo collection today, I see so many self-deprecating moments where our leaders have had some real fun. I have dressed up as Big Bird, a clown (a few times), Captain Kirk (twice), and Santa. I&rsquo;ve been thrown in a lake (a few times). I have dressed as Braveheart&rsquo;s William Wallace and ridden a live horse into a team meeting (once). I have laughed so hard I&rsquo;ve cried (many times). I will cherish these memories of sheer fun with the team as much as anything else I take away from my 21 years at Microsoft.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Myerson&rsquo;s departure will be a big loss for Microsoft, but it&rsquo;s clear that Satya Nadella is looking to shake things up, and it will be interesting to see what the future holds for Windows 10.</p>\r\n<p>Nadella&rsquo;s full email to staff explains the changes that are being made across the company:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>From: Satya Nadella<br />Sent: Thursday, March 29, 2018 7:29 AM<br />To: Microsoft -- All Employees; All MS Store Employees FTE<br />Subject: Embracing our future: Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge</p>\r\n<p>Team,</p>\r\n<p>Today, I&rsquo;m announcing the formation of two new engineering teams to accelerate our innovation and better serve the needs of our customers and partners long into the future.</p>\r\n<p>Over the past year, we have shared our vision for how the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge will shape the next phase of innovation. First, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Second, AI capabilities are rapidly advancing across perception and cognition fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Third, physical and virtual worlds are coming together to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships.</p>\r\n<p>These technological changes represent a tremendous opportunity for our customers, our partners -- everyone. With all this new technology and opportunity comes a responsibility to ensure technology&rsquo;s benefits reach people more broadly across society. It also requires that the technologies we create are trusted by the individuals and organizations that use them.</p>\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s announcement enables us to step up to this opportunity and responsibility across all our Solution Areas.</p>\r\n<p>With change comes transition, and one transition we have been planning for is for Terry Myerson to pursue his next chapter outside Microsoft. Terry has been instrumental in helping me arrive at this new organizational structure, and I deeply appreciate his leadership and insight as we&rsquo;ve worked through the opportunity that lies ahead. Over the past several years, Terry and the WDG team transformed Windows to create a secure, always up-to-date, modern OS. His strong contributions to Microsoft over 21 years from leading Exchange to leading Windows 10 leave a real legacy. I want to thank Terry for his leadership on my team and across Microsoft. He will work with me on the transition over the coming months.</p>\r\n<p>Moving forward, Rajesh Jha will expand his existing responsibilities to lead a new team focused on Experiences &amp; Devices. The purpose of this team is to instill a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices. Computing experiences are evolving to include multiple senses and are no longer bound to one device at a time but increasingly spanning many as we move from home to work and on the go. These modern needs, habits and expectations of our customers are motivating us to bring Windows, Office, and third-party applications and devices into a more cohesive Microsoft 365 experience. To further this vision, we are making the following leadership changes:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Devices: Panos Panay will now serve as our Chief Product Officer and will lead our devices vision and further our product ethos across hardware and software boundaries for our first-party devices, while creating new categories and opportunities for the entire ecosystem. He will be the key leader ensuring end-to-end devices business execution excellence.</li>\r\n<li>Windows: Joe Belfiore will continue leading our Windows experiences and will drive Windows innovation in partnership with the PC and device ecosystem. The future of Windows is bright as we continue to innovate across new scenarios and device form factors, and more deeply connect to our Microsoft 365 offerings. Joe will share more about the Windows roadmap at Build.</li>\r\n<li>New Experiences and Technology: Kudo Tsunoda will continue to lead this team to define how we engage users with high-value experiences to help them achieve more.</li>\r\n<li>Enterprise Mobility and Management: Brad Anderson will continue to lead our Windows Enterprise deployment and management efforts with even tighter alignment across Microsoft 365 and will partner closely with the EMS teams within Cloud + AI Platform.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Second, Scott Guthrie will expand his existing responsibilities to lead a new team focused on Cloud + AI Platform. The purpose of this team is to drive platform coherence and compelling value across all layers of the tech stack starting with the distributed computing fabric (cloud and edge) to AI (infrastructure, runtimes, frameworks, tools and higher-level services around perception, knowledge and cognition). To facilitate these new capabilities, we are making the following leadership changes:</p>\r\n<p>Azure: Jason Zander is being promoted to executive vice president, Azure, and will lead this team. The Windows platform team led by Harv Bhela, Henry Sanders and Michael Fortin will join Jason&rsquo;s team. Windows platform is already a core part of Azure across both the cloud and edge, and this shift will enable us to accelerate our efforts to build a unified distributed computing infrastructure and application model. Roanne Sones will continue to lead our technical engagement with OEMs, ODMs and silicon vendors, and her team will also join Jason&rsquo;s team.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Business AI: The Customer Service, Marketing and Sales Insights teams, previously led by Gurdeep Singh Pall, will join James Phillips&rsquo; Business Applications Group. I am thankful for Gurdeep&rsquo;s leadership in building these new AI solutions that are going to help differentiate Microsoft in this area. This is a notable example of taking research breakthroughs to start new product efforts grounded in customer needs and then mainstreaming them.</li>\r\n<li>Universal Store and Commerce Platform: Eric Lockard and his team will also join the Cloud + AI Platform team to both help with our own digital transformation and add new capabilities to our business application efforts.</li>\r\n<li>AI Perception &amp; Mixed Reality (MR): Alex Kipman will lead this new team, which brings together all our speech, vision, MR and additional perception capabilities into one team. This team will continue to build first-party products and the core building block cloud services for third parties on Azure. XD Huang, Yu-Ting Kuo and their teams will join this group, as well as Gurdeep&rsquo;s Ambient Intelligence team. Alex and team will take guidance on all AI-related areas from Harry Shum and work very closely with AI + Research (AI+R).</li>\r\n<li>AI Cognitive Services &amp; Platform: Eric Boyd will lead this new team and drive our AI Platform, AI Fundamentals, Azure ML, AI Tools and Cognitive Services. Joseph Sirosh and team will join this new group. Eric and team will take guidance on all AI-related areas from Harry Shum and work very closely with AI+R.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Harry Shum will continue to lead our third engineering team, AI + Research, which is instrumental in the key technology advances required across all our product teams. When we established AI+R nearly two years ago, our primary goal was to accelerate the adoption of AI innovations from research into product, and the changes we are making today reflect our strong progress. In fact, just yesterday I spent time at TechFest and came away inspired by all the innovations and most importantly how quickly they were making their way into our products. We will continue to drive investments in AI+R across research and AI breakthroughs that are key to our long-term success.</p>\r\n<p>As we make technological progress we need to ensure that we are doing so responsibly. To this end, Harry and Brad Smith have established Microsoft&rsquo;s AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research (AETHER) Committee, bringing together senior leaders from across the company to focus on proactive formulation of internal policies and how to respond to specific issues in a responsible way. AETHER will ensure our AI platform and experience efforts are deeply grounded within Microsoft&rsquo;s core values and principles and benefit the broader society. Among other steps, we are investing in strategies and tools for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and implementing new requirements established by the GDPR. While there is great opportunity, ensuring we always act responsibly for our customers and partners will continue to be a hallmark of our work.</p>\r\n<p>To truly get the best impact from our efforts, we will have to push ourselves to transcend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\">Conway&rsquo;s law</a>. Having a deep sense of customers&rsquo; unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation. We can&rsquo;t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth mindset culture matters. Each one of us needs to push on what technology can do for people and for our world. It will take courage to keep learning and growing together &mdash; encouraging one another&rsquo;s individual strengths, building more diversity and inclusion across our teams, and collaborating as One Microsoft. It&rsquo;s amazing what we have been able to accomplish together, and yet I still believe we are in the very early days of what is possible.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about these changes at the Q&amp;A next week and the important work ahead.</p>\r\n<p>Satya</p>\r\n</blockquote>', '2018-04-01 15:21:41', 'images/terrymyerson1.png', 'Terry Myerson, the executive vice president of Windows, is to leave Microsoft \"in the coming months\".

(36, '3', 'Samsung unveils Notebook 5 and Notebook 3 with 8th-gen Intel Core processors', '<p>It\'s hard not to be skeptical of news articles you read on April 1. After all, some tech companies and media outlets do enjoy a good prank on April Fools\' Day. But this announcement from Samsung does not fall into that category.</p>\r\n<p>The South Korean electronics maker today announces two new laptops that will actually hit store shelves. They\'re called Notebook 5 and Notebook 3 and come with a premium design, 8th-generation quad-core Intel Core \"Kaby Lake R\" processors, and large displays.</p>\r\n<p>The Notebook 5 (pictured at the top) is the more powerful option of the two, featuring the fastest graphics card of the bunch, namely an Nvidia MX150 with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM. The Notebook 3 (pictured below), which is offered in a 14-inch and a 15-inch version, can be had only with a built-in or slower MX110 graphics card, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The Notebook 5 comes with a 15-inch display, with 1080p resolution and what Samsung calls \"Wide Viewing\" (which probably indicates the panel\'s IPS technology), while the 15-inch Notebook 3 can also be had with a lower-resolution HD display. Meanwhile, the 14-inch Notebook 3 is equipped with an HD panel only.</p>\r\n<p>All laptops come with DDR4 RAM (Samsung does not mention the amount that\'s available or if it can be expanded), an SSD and HDD combo, a VGA camera and a 43Wh battery. What\'s interesting is that Samsung will also offer these models with dual-core Kaby Lake (7th-generation) Core processors, most likely to lower the barrier of entry for consumers who do not want the better performance or battery life that the current generation offers.</p>\r\n<p>Both the Notebook 5 and Notebook 3 in 15-inch trim weigh 1.97 kg. They measure 377.4 x 248.6 x 19.9 mm and 377.4 x 248.6 x 19.6 mm, respectively. The 14-inch Notebook 3 is the smallest and lightest of the bunch, as you would expect, coming in at 1.66 kg and 336 x 232.9 x 19.8mm.</p>\r\n<p>Samsung says that the Notebook 5 and Notebook 3 will be available starting this month in South Korea, with other markets to follow in the coming months. There is no word on pricing or exact specifications at this stage.</p>', '2018-04-01 18:35:31', 'images/Samsung-Notebook-5-e1522582276737.jpg', 'It\'s hard not to be skeptical of news articles you read on April 1.
